= QUAD Format Specification v0.2
by Rufas Wan
:toc:

== Introduction

QUAD file is mainly for 2D sprites on modern 3D graphics engine. Every drawing is a polygon in square, rectangle, or other quadrilaterals (hence the name QUAD).

The major difference from 2D sprite:

* Instead creating a new drawing for every new frame, the sprites can be transform using GPU. Special effects uses this a lot.
* Two transformation can be interpolate during animation. This creates a new type of sprites with doll-like movement.
* If the 2D sprite is properly layered, its depth value can be faked, allowing dynamic lighting and shadow calculations later.

The major difference from 3D model:

* It is still animated in frames, instead of using delta time. On a normal 60 FPS (frames per seconds) game, 1 frame is 16.67 milliseconds.
* Z or depth value are not used. It is faked on drawing for perspective correction.
* X and Y is the same as 2D image. +X is right direction, +Y is down direction, and they are in px (pixels).
* As every polygons are quadrilateral with 4 unique x,y coordinates, indices are not used. They are auto-generated when drawing as 2 triangles.

== Basic File Structure

A QUAD file consists of multiple sub objects:

* "keyframe" defines the drawings of a frame.
* "hitbox" defines the areas for collusion detection for a frame.
* "animation" defines the changes between frames over time.
* "skeleton" defines the relationship between frames.
