== Tools (PHP)

* For everything in `tools` folder, just run the PHP script directly with the files. No web server required.
** `php.exe  psxtools/img_clut2png.php  0000.rgba  0001.rgba...`

* Windows's cmd.exe 8191 character limit workaround
** cmd.exe is very limited, and won't work when `*.rgba` is over the character limit
** made a simple PHP script to generate a command on each file
** NORMAL : `php.exe  psxtools/img_clut2png.php  *.rgba`
** LOOP : `php.exe  psxtools/tsr_cmdloop.php  rgba  "php.exe psxtools/img_clut2png.php"`
